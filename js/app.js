  Practice domain modeling by planning out an app w that allows users to choose their favorite between two pizzas


  App Flow:
  - Randomly put 2 pizzas on the screen
    - Random number generator
    - a function to display pizzas
  - A user clicks on a pizza
    - event listener needs to be on the image to fire the event handler
    - the event handler fires
      - ? check if total clicks is 5 ?
        - stop letting the user click
        - display the clicks
      -? If not ?
        - track which pizza was clicked on
        - update click images count of how many times it has been clicked on
        - update both images'count of times shown
        - Randomly Pick 2 pizzas, run the same code that put them on the screen to begin with

  HTML
    - have a left and right image container in the html
    - Give them id's so we can select them// in demo today we are grab DOM elements differently.
    - let the user know what they are supposed to do
      - instructions

  More javascript details
  We need Objects with all the image properties
  const Image = function ()
  {
    name : 'Chicago Pizza',
    clicks: 0,
    timesShown: 0,
    url : 'chicagoPizza.jpeg'
  };

  We need an Array to hold all image Objects

  function to randomly pick an image{
    Prevent last picked pizzas from being picked
      - STRETCH pick all pizzas evenly as possible
    Math.floor  Math.random() * array.length()
    make sure left and right image are unique
  }

  click on an image, targetted by id
  add event listener('click', function(){
    keep track of the image that is clicked
    prevent all currently displayed images from being re clicked {
    }
  })

  function to display all the clicks at the end () {
    generate a table or ul list
    populate the data - adds to the inner html of an existing element (table or list)
    divide object's times clicked by total shown
  }
